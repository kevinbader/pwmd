# pwmd

pwmd exposes the Linux' sysfs PWM interface to DBUS.

## Why

PWM controllers are often used for LEDs. Playing around with LEDs is fun and it's also super easy to control them, thanks to a simple sysfs based API the Linux kernel exposes. Only drawback: your hacky script needs root privileges to use it.

With pwmd you can use DBUS to control LEDs without root privileges. Under the hood, pwmd uses the sysfs API - it exposes this part of sysfs to user-space via DBUS, without running the risk of scripts causing mayhem to other parts of sysfs.

## Getting started
